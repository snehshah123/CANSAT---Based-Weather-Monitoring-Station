# CANSAT---Based-Weather-Monitoring-Station
This project details the development of a compact, cost-effective weather monitoring system for a CANSATâ€”a can-sized satellite.  The system is designed to collect and transmit atmospheric data, including temperature, pressure, and motion data, during a satellite's descent, making it suitable for educational and aerospace research applications.
